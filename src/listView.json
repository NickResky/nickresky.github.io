has several field types so you can track any information you need and enrich your items with relevant, workable data. For example, you can add a time estimate field, due date, cost field (with currency) or a label field to categorize your items. Some fields allow you to work with other items you've created, even if they're not in the same collection!\n\nFields are represented in different ways, depending on the view you're in. In table view, each column represents a field. In Kanban, list, and calendar view, fields are shown on the item itself, and can be edited from the detail view. When you add a field, it applies to all of the items in a collection. \n\nLastly, all fields are completely customizable, and you can add a description to each so every member of your team knows how to use it. Here's a quick breakdown of the different field types, what they can do, and how you can customize them:\n\n<h3>Text</h3>\n\nText fields can contain any text, numbers or links, but are displayed as plain text only (numbers won't be included in formulas). \n\nText fields can be single or multiline: Single line text works best for short texts - customer names, book titles, product names etc. \n\n<img 1 - text field properties>\n\nMultiline text fields, on the other hand, will display as full paragraphs on your items and you can use them to add a lot more detail - a product description, a blog article draft, or awesome feedback that you get from customers. The multiline text editing box gives you enough space to edit and move text around as you need to. Use Shift + Enter to start the next line while typing. \n\n<img 2 - multiline text field example> \n\nYou can also choose to include a default text that will appear in each new item created. For example, if you track support communications in a separate collection, you could create a template of text to be used in various support cases.\n\n<h3>Number</h3>\n\nNumber fields contain numbers only and can be formatted as a Decimal, Integer or Currency. \n\n<img 3 - number field properties>\n\nIf you choose currency, you will be able to select which one from a drop down menu. You can also choose a default value that will appear in each new item created.\n\n<h3>Link</h3>\n\nA link field contains a single link. Links will open in a new tab when clicked on from anywhere within Zenkit (any view, or in the detail panel).\n\n<img 4 - link field on item>\n\n<h3>Date</h3>\n\nThe date field adds a date to an item and will show it in the calendar for the chosen date. You can choose to include a time as well. Dates can also be displayed as a duration instead (as in ‘3 days ago’ or ‘in 3 days’).\n\n<img 5 - date field properties>\n\nTo schedule a date, click on the date field in detail view, or double click on the date cell in table view. When the calendar shows up, click on a date to assign it to the item.\n\n<img 6 - schedule add date to item>\n \nThe current date is displayed with a small arrow in the bottom right corner, and the date you’ve selected is blue. To unschedule an item, click the trash can icon.\n\nIf you've set the field to also show time, you can add a time to an item. 12:00 is scheduled by default. If you want to change the time, you can either type the time into the field above the calendar, or you can click the clock icon under the calendar to open the clock interface.\n\n<img 7 - schedule change time on item>\n\n<h3>Checkbox</h3>\n\nA checkbox adds a simple checkbox to each item. Checkboxes are useful if you need a true/false value for an item - for example, 'Has peanut allergy', or 'Has off-planet experience', or simply 'Done' or 'Read'.\n\n<img 8 - checkbox field example>\n\nAs with other fields, you can choose a default action - in this case having it checked or not by default. \n\n<h3>Files</h3>\n\nThe files field lets you attach multiple images, documents or videos to an item. A file field can be added manually, or it will be created automatically if you drag a file or image onto an item. You can even add a file to an open item by using the Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V for mac) shortcut! Click on 'Add a file...' under the file field name, then paste it in the add file popup. \n\n<img 9 - add upload file>\n\nPlease note that you won't be able to drag & drop files onto items if another field is active (eg. when your text field is being edited). File fields can be renamed, but there are no further options available.\n\nAttached files can be displayed in different ways. Click on the view menu to the top right and click 'Details' to open the view options. There you'll see four buttons that let you choose how to display thumbnail images in the current view.\n\n<img 10 - image position buttons>\n\nYou can choose the thumbnail style that suits you best, and click on images to expand them:\n\n<gif 1 - file field thumbnail display>\n\nIn case you have multiple attachments, the last image to be attached is the one displayed in the thumbnail.\n\nTo delete attached files, click on the small trash can icon above the file in detail view.\n\n<img 11 - delete file>\n\nOr click 'Delete' at the top right corner of the expanded file popup.\n\n<img 12 - delete file from expanded view>\n\n<h3>Members</h3>\n\nThe Members field allows you to add one or more members to an item. You can choose whether users can add multiple members or not. \n\n<img 13 - members field properties>\n\nThe member field can also be used as a list header in Kanban view.\n\n<img 14 - member as list header>\n\n<h3>Labels</h3>\n\nThe labels field is one of the most useful and flexible fields in Zenkit. When you create a new label field, you can add new labels and assign each label a color. \n\n<img 15 - label field properties>\n\nYou can choose whether or not users can select multiple labels, and also whether they’re able to create new labels on the fly. You can also select a label to be used by default when a new item is created. Label fields are used as list headers in Kanban view.\n\n<gif 2 - create new label field>\n\nFor example, in your ‘Build Spaceship’ collection, you have created labels for ‘Progress’ and ‘Priority’, each of which allows only one label to be selected and doesn’t allow users to create new labels. Each new task is assigned the ‘To Do’ label in the progress field by default, but you assign priority manually. \n\n<h3>Checklist</h3>\n\nA checklist is the only field that applies only to the item you’re working on, instead of the whole collection. \n\nTo add items to a checklist, expand your item to the details view. Click 'Add Item' at the bottom of your checklist.\n\n<img 16 - add item to checklist>\n\nTo delete an item, hover over it and click on the 'x' that appears at the end.\n\n<img 17 - delete item from checklist>\n\nTo change the order of the items on your checklist, just drag and drop them into the appropriate positions.\n\n<img 18 - checklist drag and drop>\n\nTo check an item off once it's done, click the checkbox next to its name.\n\n<img 19 - complete item checklist>\n\nTo hide checked items, click on the checklist name or small arrow icon to bring up the checklist options menu. Click 'Hide checked items'.\n\n<img 20 - hide checked items>\n\n<h3>Formula, Reference and Aggregation fields</h3>\n\nFormula, Reference and Aggregation fields are fields that allow you to work with two or more items in combination.\n\nRead the <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/Skm54QYA\" target=\"_blank\">guide to formulas and aggregations</a> to learn how to calculate using items and references. Or read the <a href=\"(https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/rJYZvQYA\" target=\"_blank\">guide to reference fields</a> to find out how to connect items in Zenkit.","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"Guide to the basic field types\nUnlike a spreadsheet, Airtable fields (columns) have specific \"types\" that allow you to store rich content in each record. For example, a table can contain records (rows) with attachments, long text notes, checkboxes, and links to records in another table.\n\nWith all of these different field types, you can configure a table to perfectly fit your needs! You configure the field type in the field configuration menu.\n\nHere's a brief overview of each field type you can use to make the perfect table for your use case:\n\nSingle line text\n\nLong text\n\nAttachment\n\nCheckbox\n\nSingle select\n\nMultiple select\n\nDate (and time)\n\nPhone number\n\nEmail\n\nURL\n\nNumber\n\nCurrency\n\nPercent\n\nFormula/Rollup/Lookup/Count\n\nAutonumber\n\nLinked record field \n\nBarcode\n\n\n\nSingle line text\n\nA single line text field accepts a single line of text for each cell. You can put any text value you want into each cell.\n\nThe single line text field is best for short, unique pieces of text, such as the names of your friends, the names of your cats, or the names of your friends' cats. If you notice that you're repeating the same text values frequently in a column, you may want to consider using a single select, multiple select, or linked record field.\n\n \nLong text\n\nA long text field is great when you need to keep notes or multiple lines of text in each record. You can enter new lines into a long text field, and even @mention a collaborator inside the text.\n\nExpanding a long text field gives you plenty of room:\n\n\nAttachment\n\nAn attachment field allows you to attach multiple files directly to your Airtable records. If the file is an image, the cell will show a nice image thumbnail of the files you've attached.\n\nFor most document attachments, you'll see a preview thumbnail of the document.\n\nClicking on an attachment preview will open up a full screen lightbox attachment browser that will allow you to view every attachment in the cell. From here, you can download or remove the attachment by clicking the icons in the bottom right corner.\n\n\n\nYou can also reorder your attachments from the expanded cell view by clicking and dragging.\n\nThe lightbox view also supports reordering by clicking and dragging the thumbnails at the bottom of the screen:\n\nWatch a short tutorial below.\n\n\nCheckbox\n\nA checkbox field is useful for true/false values within a record. For example, a task tracking base might have a checkbox field called \"Done\" that you can check off when a task is complete.\n\nWhen your cursor is over a checkbox cell, you can hit enter to check/uncheck it. Alternatively, you can click on the cell to check/uncheck.\n\n\nSingle select\n\nCreating a Single Select Dropdown Option in Airtable from Airtable on Vimeo.\n\nA single select field is ideal when you want to be able to select a single option from a set list of options. When you edit a cell, you will be presented with an autocomplete menu. You can select the desired option from the dropdown menu, or type to narrow down the list of options. \n\nYou can add, remove, and edit select options in the field configuration menu.\n\nYou can also reorder the select options from within the field configuration menu by clicking and dragging on the reorder icons, which appear when you mouse over the left-hand side of each select option.\n\nYou can also create a new select option without going to the field configuration menu by typing in the name of an option and selecting the \"+Create a new option named ...\" item.\n\nIf you're wishing you could store additional information related to each select option, you might consider converting the single select field into a record link. Then, you can have a full record for each option.\n\n \n\nMultiple select\n\nA multiple select cell is basically the same as a single select except it allows you to select multiple options. Each select option is displayed as a small token that can be removed by clicking the x.\n\nYou can reorder your multiple select options from within the expanded cell by clicking and dragging.\n\nYou can also do this from within the field configuration menu by clicking and dragging on the reorder icons, which appear when you mouse over the left-hand side of each select option:\n\nAs with single select, if you find yourself wanting to keep track of more things related to each select option, you should probably convert the multiple select field into a record link.\n\n \nDate (and time)\n\nA date field allows you to easily enter a date and optionally a time into a cell. When editing a date time, you will be presented with a calendar widget that makes it easy to select a specific date.\n\nIn the field configuration menu, you can configure the date field to also store a time.\n\nYou can also click the dropdown menu under \"Choose the date format\" to choose between various different date formats.\n\nDate cells will now show date and time fields.\n\n\nPhone number\n\nA phone number field will format the text in each cell as a US phone number, in the form (XXX) XXX-XXXX.\n\nPhone number fields are particularly advantageous on mobile, where you'll be presented with a specific phone keyboard when editing the phone number. You can also tap buttons to call or text that number.\n\n\nEmail\n\nA email field is intended to store a single email address in each cell. Clicking on an email address within an email field will open up your computer's native email client with the To: field addressed to the email you just clicked on.\n\n\nURL\n\nA URL field is intended to store a single URL in each cell. Clicking on a URL will bring you to that URL.\n\n\nNumber\n\nA number field will only accept a number value, and provide formatting options for the number.\n\nA number field can be formatted as either an integer or decimal. For a decimal, you can specify the number of significant digits. You can allow negative decimals or integers by checking the \"Allow negative numbers\" box.\n\n \n\nCurrency\n\nA currency field is a specific type of number column that formats the number as a currency amount. You can specify a currency symbol (the default is \"$\"), the number of significant digits, and whether or not to allow negative currency amounts.\n\n\nPercent\n\nA percent field is a specific type of number column that formats the number as a percentage. You can select the precision of the percentage in the field configuration menu. You can also choose to allow negative percentages by checking the \"Allow negative numbers\" box.\n\n\nFormula,  Rollup,  Lookup,  Count\n\nFormula, rollup, lookup, and count are all computed field types. These fields compute their values based off of other fields in the same table or linked tables.\n\nTo learn more about these computed field types, please read the Guide to formula, rollup, lookup, and count fields.\n\n\nAutonumber\n\nAn autonumber column automatically generates a unique, automatically incremented number for each record. Autonumbers can be helpful when you need a unique identifier for each record, or when using a formula in the primary field.\n\nNote that the autonumber field is not designed to count the number of records in a table. When a record is deleted, the remaining records are not re-numbered. This leaves gaps in the numbering.\n\nTo re-number an autonumber column (in order to remove gaps, for example), you can either delete and re-create an autonumber column, or convert the column to a different type and then back to autonumber.\n\n\nLinked record field\n\nA linked record field is a powerful way to link together related tables in a base. To learn more about this field type, read the article on linked record fields.\n\n\nBarcode\n\nIf you use the mobile Airtable client, then you can use the camera in your mobile device to scan several types of barcodes and QR codes.\n\nWhile you cannot scan barcodes directly into the desktop version of Airtable, any barcodes scanned in the mobile version will appear in the web client, and can be altered manually from there.\n\nThe full list of barcode types that the barcode field supports is:\n\nUPCE\nCode39\nEAN13\nEAN8\nCode93\nCode128\nPDF417 (Macro)\nPDF417\nQR (numeric, alphanumeric,

The name is meant to be a short, unique representation of each record in your table.\n\nThe primary field is required so that it can be used as a brief description of a record in other parts of the UI. For example, if you link a record to another table, we show the value of the primary field in a small card representing the linked record:\n\nWe also use the primary field as the title of record cards, which we show in the iOS app and a number of other places:\n\nThe primary field is most often a text type field, but it can also support most other field types, including date, number, autonumber, and formula field types. However, the primary field will not support attachment, checkbox, single select, multiple select, rollup, lookup, and count fields, or links to other records. \n\nIf your table does not lend itself particularly well to a single unique primary field, a useful technique is to set the primary field as a formula type, and to compose the name of each record using values from the other fields in your table.

Most fields allow you to set a default value, and others, like the number field for example, allow you to be very granular in the properties you set. For more information about the different field properties, please read our <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/By04o9z0\" target=\"_blank\">guide to basic fields</a>.\n\n<h3>Renaming fields</h3>\n\nTo rename a field, open the field properties popup and type the new name into the 'Name' bar. The new field name will be used wherever field names are displayed (as a table column header, for example).\n\nYou can also rename fields in table view by clicking on the ... icon next to the field name (column header) and clicking 'Rename'.\n\n<h3>Converting field types</h3>\n\nYou may find you need to convert a field - for example, if you started tracking costs in a text field, but then needed to use them in a formula, you could convert it to a number field. You can also convert different number field types (eg. integer to currency or decimal) if needs be.\n\nTo convert a field type, open the field properties popup and under 'Type', select the type of field you'd like to convert to.\n\n<img 3 - change field type>\n\nZenkit will try it's best to convert the fields in a meaningful way, however some conversions are not possible. For example, converting a text field to a formula field will cause the text to be removed. Converting a file field into any other type of field will cause the attachments to be removed. Please be very sure that you need to convert before you make any changes, since you cannot undo this action.\n\nCertain characters may also affect the conversion, for example, a '$' or any lettered text in a text field that you're converting to a currency field will cause an error. Only pure numbers can be converted.","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"Customizing the field type\nYou can customize the field (column) type in the field customization menu. To open the field customization menu, click on the menu icon in the column header you want to customize, and select the \"Customize field type\" option. Alternatively, you can double-click on the field header to open the customization menu.\n\n\n\nAfter clicking \"Customize field type,\" click on the field type button to open the menu of different field types. After selecting a new field type, be sure to click the blue \"Save\" button—otherwise,b your type changes will not be saved.\n\n\n\nDifferent field types have different customization options. Checkbox fields, for example, have no additional customization options:\n\n\n\nNumber fields, on the other hand, allow you to set whether the numbers should be formatted as integers or decimals, whether or not to allow negative numbers, and whether or not to set a default field value. For more information on each field type, check out our guide to field types.\n\n\n\nAirtable does its best to convert existing cell values to the new type during a field conversion, but some conversions may not be possible with certain types. For example, converting a text field to an attachment field will clear all the text values, since plain text values do not represent an attachment. If you see that you have lost some cell values during a conversion, you can undo your change to return the field to its previous state (and restore the data that was lost due to the conversion).","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[95,96,97],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[{"id":95,"shortId":"SkCdoMKC","uuid":"3f34aa5d-07ff-46f2-8404-bc6bd49a54ac","fileName":"open_field_properties_from_detail_view.PNG","size":25588,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/SkCdoMKC","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-10T13:45:25.969+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-10T13:45:25.969+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"w":"240"},{"w":"44","crop":"0,0,44,44"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":96,"shortId":"HkeRuoGtA","uuid":"ab8a71c2-5600-4f23-a509-1a787e02c80d","fileName":"open_field_properties_from_table_view.PNG","size":42383,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/HkeRuoGtA","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-10T13:45:26.202+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-10T13:45:26.202+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"},{"w":"44","crop":"0,0,44,44"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":97,"shortId":"B15YjMtA","uuid":"717aca36-a530-4d17-8004-5af9e76f19cc","fileName":"change_field_type.PNG","size":66938,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/B15YjMtA","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-10T13:45:38.15+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-10T13:45:38.15+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"},{"h":"400","w":"400","crop":"0,0,40,40"},{"w":"44","crop":"0,0,44,44"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"}],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":24,"shortId":"ryTBjcG0","uuid":"458f410c-6d57-450b-ac58-b4d99f441f55","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-05T15:24:53.236Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T09:51:36.227Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Adding a field","sortOrder":"1.0054999999999994","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Adding a field","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[11],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"b37a45b0-8fbf-4bca-85a5-3c1a50ed9a68","id":11,"name":"Fields"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[5],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"f68c3894-e4d7-4d02-8755-7ef9639c2ab9","id":5,"name":"done"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"Adding a field is simple and can be done from any view in Zenkit.\n\nIn table view, scroll to the far right column and click 'Add Field'.\n\n<img 1 - add field table view>\n\nSelect the type of field you'd like to add from the 'Add Field to Collection' popup.\n\n<img 2 - add field to collection popup table view>\n\nIn Kanban view you can add a field by clicking on the <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/SJfUjcfR\" target-\"_blank\">aggregation badge</a> and choosing 'Create new field' from the dropdown menu.\n\n<img 3 - create new field kanban view>\n\nYou can also add a field from the details panel or popup.

You can give it a custom icon, change what items are called and change the background color or image, so each collection has its own personality. \n\nOpen the collection settings popup from the Zenkit home page or by clicking on the collection title when it’s open.\n\n<h3>Item Naming</h3>\n\nUnder the 'Settings' tab you can choose what items will be called throughout the collection. For example, if you’re creating a project collection, you could call them ‘Tasks’. If you’re creating an applicant database, you could call them ‘Applicants’. \n\n<img 1 - customize collection item name>\n\n<h3>Collection Icon</h3>\n\nYou can also choose an icon specific to your collection. This will help it stand out amongst your other collections. Select from the set of pre-loaded icons, or choose your own by clicking on the '?' tile.\n \n<Img 2 - add custom icon to collection>\n\nZenkit uses icons from the Font Awesome collection. To find the perfect icon for your collection, click ‘Find Icons’ to be taken to the Font Awesome icon base.\n\n<img 3 - font awesome icon search>\n\nSearch for an icon there, and type in the exact name of that icon in the Custom Icon field. Try typing ‘users’ for a person based collection, or ‘birthday-cake’ for a party planning collection!\n\n<h3>Collection Background</h3>\nTo change the collection background, go to the 'Background' tab in the collection settings popup.\n\n<img 4 - change collection background>\n\nHere you can choose to have no background (you collection will use the team background), a plain color, pattern, suggested photo, or a theme.

Spreadsheets are great for working with numbers, and Kanban boards are better for project management. Everyone also has favorites - favorite tools, favorite work styles, favorite methods.. \n\nGetting all these tools and work styles to play together nicely is a tough task many companies face.\n\nViews in Zenkit represent different tools you can use to work with your data. Every view has the same data at its core, which just means that you can switch to the tool that suits you and your task best, without having to export, import or modify your data in any way.\n\nZenkit currently has a table, Kanban, list and calendar view (but there are more on the way!). Here's an example of how these different views work together:\n\nYou're working on a mission to Mars, and the biggest project is building the spaceship that will take you there. You create a collection called 'Build Spaceship' to manage the project.\n\n- You start out by creating a simple list of all the tasks that need to get done in list view.\n- When you're managing the progress of the project, you use Kanban and 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Done' lists.\n- You need to track cost and time estimates, as well as manage inventory, so you input those numbers for each task in the table view.\n- When assigning tasks to your team members, you switch back to Kanban.\n- To assign test, delivery, and due dates to tasks, you use the calendar.\n\nIn the end, all you're doing is looking at the same core of data from a different perspective. Every time you make an update in table view, for example, that update is reflected in every other view!\n\nThe views themselves are highly flexible so that every member of your team can find a way to use the data that suits them best. As a rule, changes that you make to the way a view is displayed (hiding columns, using 2D Kanban, moving columns in tables or lists in Kanban) will not be shown to other users. When this is not the case, we'll let you know!\n\n<h3>Switching between views</h3>\n\nEach new collection opens up to list view. Once your project gets a little more detailed, you may want to see it in Kanban form. Click where it says ‘List’ in the top right corner and choose ‘Kanban’ from the dropdown menu. \n\n<gif 1 - switch between views>\n\nIf you want to see a table, just choose ‘Table’, or click ‘Calendar’ to use the calendar.\n\nTo learn more about the different views, check out our guides to <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/rJYmLkEC\" target=\"_blank\">Kanban</a>, <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/rk0plyE0\" target=\"_blank\">table</a>, <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/SJrTly4C\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> and <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/r1xpgyNR\" target=\"_blank\">calendar</a> views!","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/202624989-Guide-to-views\n\nToo long for desc. field. Structured as follows:\n\nVideo showing how to create a new view.\n\nIntro: \nThis article provides an overview of views within Airtable—what they are, why they're important, and how to make new ones. This article is primarily focused on grid views—to learn more about our other view types, please see the articles for creating forms, calendar views, gallery views, and grouped records.\n\nYou may also want to read a related article on sharing or embedding a view on your website.\n\nWhat is a view?\n\nIn a spreadsheet, every user sees the data in the same way—if you want to hide or freeze columns, for example, everyone else will be forced to see those changes as well.\n\nIn a database like Airtable, however, you can create any number of views, which are set, specified ways of looking at your data. What does this mean? Well, here are some examples of views you could create:\n\nIf you have a table of tasks, you could create separate views for each team member, each of which would only show the tasks assigned to a particular team member.\nIf you have a table with many, many fields, you can create a view which will hide certain fields and make the table a little easier to navigate.\nIf you have a table of meetings with clients, you could create a calendar view which will plot all of your client meetings on a monthly calendar.\nThe important thing to understand is that a view is just a different way of looking at the same underlying data! (This means that if you edit the data in a record while in one view, it will change that data for all views, since all views are looking at the same record.)\n\nIn fact, whenever you're looking at your data in Airtable, you're always looking at your data through a view! Even if you're looking at your data through the default \"Main View\" that comes with every new table, you're still looking at your data through a view.\n\nA grid view, or table view, is the default view type of an Airtable database on the web client. It closely resembles a spreadsheet as the records and fields are organized into rows and columns, respectively.\n\nThen focus on grid view (Table view in zenkit):\n\nCreate a new grid view\n\nHide fields\n\nAdd filters\n\nSort records\n\n(Most are worthy of separate articles in a different section I think - perhaps called 'Actions' - to cover filter, sort, bulk actions etc)\n\nOther view types - intro\n\nThen a short description of the following with a link to the extended article:\n\nCalendar view\n\nGallery view\n\nGrouped records","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[77],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[{"id":77,"shortId":"r1UDbGSC","uuid":"bdefa404-a50f-4918-94a1-7b8ef3bdcbf2","fileName":"switch_between_views.PNG","size":17977,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/r1UDbGSC","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-07T12:13:17.813+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-07T12:13:17.813+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"},{"h":"400","w":"400","crop":"0,0,40,40"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"}],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":39,"shortId":"Bknnx1V0","uuid":"049d8b28-12c8-4043-a154-027ccef0250e","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-06T14:33:24.386Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T14:55:16.396Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Creating forms with Airtable","sortOrder":"1.0082816406249993","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Creating forms with Airtable","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[12],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"4f5847e8-b195-4032-91f6-e15a53467027","id":12,"name":"Views"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[3],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"6503a58f-6c18-491b-b051-e5755734cd71","id":3,"name":"airtable original / todo"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[7],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"77d7d06d-ebbb-437f-a4ef-0a13136041e7","id":7,"name":"Upcoming"}],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":40,"shortId":"r1xpgyNR","uuid":"efdd02e1-290e-486e-9e89-103a7db99fd2","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-06T14:33:27.779Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T10:15:44.869Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Guide to calendar view","sortOrder":"1.0041999999999995","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Guide to calendar view","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[12],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"4f5847e8-b195-4032-91f6-e15a53467027","id":12,"name":"Views"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[5],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"f68c3894-e4d7-4d02-8755-7ef9639c2ab9","id":5,"name":"done"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"The Zenkit calendar is a very simple tool that shows your items as they’re scheduled in a monthly or weekly calendar view.\n\n<h3>Creating items in calendar view</h3>\n\nTo create a new item in calendar view from Month mode, simply click on the + button in the top right corner of the date you’d like to add the item to. \n\n<img 1 - add item to calendar>\n\nIf you’re viewing the calendar in Week mode, click the ‘Add Item’ button under the date you’d like to add the item to.\n\n<img 2 - add item to calendar week mode>\n\nThe new item will be created with that date already assigned to it.\n\n<h3>Switching between weeks and months</h3>\n\nTo switch between week and month mode, just click ‘Week’ or ‘Month’ in the top right hand corner of the calendar.

If you do not already have one, you will be required to create a new one using the \"Create a new date field\" option.)\n\nOnce a date field has been selected, your calendar view will populate with the records from the selected date field.\n\nChanging a calendar view's associated date field\n\nIn the view bar, there's a section (with a little calendar icon) which tells you which date field you're currently using for this calendar view.\n\nClicking on this will bring up the date picker again. From here, you can change the associated date field (by clicking on the appropriate radio button) or create an entirely new date field (by clicking \"Create a new date field\").\n\nCreating records within calendar view\n\nYou can create a new record within calendar view simply by clicking on a date on the calendar. The date field for the new record associated with the current calendar will be automatically be set to the date that was clicked.\n\nEditing records within calendar view\n\nYou can edit records directly from the calendar by clicking on a card. This will bring up a mini-editor from which you can edit the primary field or the associated date field being used for scheduling. Clicking on the \"Edit details\" button will bring up the expanded record view; clicking on the \"Delete\" button will delete the record.\n\nYou can also edit a record by clicking on a card in the side bar, which will open up that record's expanded view.\n\nClicking and dragging a card on the calendar will also reschedule the event, editing the value in its date field. Dragging a record card from the sidebar onto a date on the calendar will also change an event's date. If you drag a record to the sidebar, that will clear the value in the date field, \"unscheduling\" it.\n\nNote that any changes made on the calendar view are also reflected in the grid view in the appropriate date field column!\n\n The calendar view sidebar\n\nAs mentioned in Editing records within calendar view, you can use the sidebar to schedule or reschedule events by clicking and dragging records to and from the sidebar.\n\nYou can also use the find record box to search through your records—it'll search through all of the fields for your query, not just the names of the records.\n\nYou can also click the dropdown arrow next to \"All records\" to instead view only records with dates (arranged in chronological order), or to view only records without dates.\n\nDeleting a calendar view\n\nTo delete a calendar view, simply click on the ellipsis button in the view bar and select the \"Delete calendar\" option.\n\nCalendar integrations\n\nYou can integrate an Airtable calendar view with your favorite third-party calendar app by getting an iCal link from a shared calendar view. For more specific instructions on how to do this, please see this article on integrating Airtable with external calendar applications.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use Zapier to integrate with an external calendar app. See this article on how to integrate Airtable with Google Calendar using Zapier.","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[65,66,67,68,69,73,75],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[{"id":65,"shortId":"BkdRzgV0","uuid":"4c2b9092-6347-4c30-ba42-a14c3f0d6fbe","fileName":"Add_item_to_calendar.PNG","size":2160,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/BkdRzgV0","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-06T15:50:40.315+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-06T15:50:40.315+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"},{"h":"400","w":"400","crop":"0,0,40,40"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan

Click a third time to remove the sort on that column.\n \n<img 4 - sort items in table view>\n\nThe sort direction is shown with a small arrow icon next to the field name.\n\n<h3>Hiding fields (columns)</h3>\n\nTo hide a field (column), click on the the field name (column header) and click ‘Hide’.\n \n<img 5 - hide column in table view>\n\nTo show a field again once it’s been hidden, click on the table icon in the top right to drop down the view options. Click on ‘Details’ next to ‘Table’ and choose which columns to show or hide from the dropdown menu.\n\n<img 6 - show or hide fields columns table view>\n \nVisible fields are displayed in blue, hidden fields are grey. To make a field visible, just click on it and it will appear in the table.\n\n<h3>Deleting fields (columns)</h3>\n\nTo delete a field (column) from your collection, click on the field name (column header) then choose 'Delete' from the dropdown menu.\n\n<img 7 - delete field column from table view>\n\nYou then need to confirm that you want to delete this field.\n\n<img 8 - delete field column from table view confirmation>\n\nPlease note that deleting a field is permanent! You won't be able to retrieve the field once it's gone, so make sure you really want to remove it before you do!\n\n<h3>Changing column width</h3>\n\nSome fields contain a lot of information, so in Zenkit you can change the width of your columns so you can see that all at once.\n\nJust click and hold a divider next to the column header, and drag to the width you want.\n\n<gif 1 - change column width>\n\n<h3>Reordering columns</h3>\n\nYou can also change the order of your columns easily: click on a column header to drag and drop it to where you need it to be.\n\n<gif 2 - reorder columns table view>\n\nReordering tables in this way won't affect how other members see the table.","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"A grid view, or table view, is the default view type of an Airtable database on the web client. It closely resembles a spreadsheet as the records and fields are organized into rows and columns, respectively.\n\nHere's an example of a grid view:\n\n<img>\n\nWhen you create a new, blank database, the first view you'll see in a new table will be the default \"Main View,\" which doesn't have any hidden fields, filtered records, or specific sorting. \n\nCreate a new grid view\n\nTo create a new view, click on the view switcher in the view bar, then click the \"Grid\" option under the \"Create a new view\" header.\n\nOnce you've created your new view, you can name it, show/hide fields, filter out records, and order the records manually or through sorting. The attributes of a grid view that can be saved include:\n\nWhich records (rows) have been filtered\nWhich fields (columns) are hidden or shown\nThe sorting/order of the records (rows) and fields (columns)\nThe width of each field\nThe number of frozen fields fixed on the left side of the table\nAfter you've created a few views, you can switch between them easily by selecting views from the view switcher.\n \n\nHide fields\n\nYou can hide fields (columns) in your view by clicking the \"Hide fields\" button and unchecking the fields that you want to hide. The \"hide all\" and \"show all\" buttons will let you quickly hide/show all fields (except the primary field, which cannot be hidden).\n\nAlternatively, you can click on a field's field configuration

Calendar, Fantastical, or Outlook? You can get an iCal link from a shared calendar view, and if you subscribe to this iCal link in a calendar app, it will sync the events from your Airtable base to your calendar.\n\nTo start, go to a calendar view.

You may download the ICS file by pasting the link for the iCal feed into your browser address bar (e.g. in Chrome), then pressing enter. Your browser will then download this file directly to your computer's downloads folder, and you can import it into the calendar program of your choice.

In Zenkit however, a list in Kanban actually represents a label in a label field. Here's how it all works:\n\n<h3>Labels and list headers</h3>\n\nTo create a new list click the 'Add List...' button. Type in the name of your list, then hit Enter.\n\n<img 1 - add list in kanban>\n\nIf you set up a simple Kanban board with lists titled 'To Do', 'In Progress' and 'Done', those three titles belong to one label field, let's call it 'Progress'.\n\n<img 2 - progress labels kanban>\n\nWhen you create a new item under one of those headers, or move it from one list to another, that label is applied to the item.\n\nBy default, when you first create a set of labels (list headers) in Kanban, the field will be called 'Category'. To learn how to change this field name, read our article on <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/HkYSo9fA\" target=\"_blank\">customizing and converting fields</a>.\n\n<h3>Creating items in Kanban view</h3>\n\nClick on the + button next to the list name to create a new item at the top of that Kanban list.\n\n<img 3 - add item to kanban from plus button>\n\nYou can also hover over the bottom of a list you’d like to add an item to and the ‘Add Item…’ button will appear. \n \n<img 4 - add item to kanban from add item button>\n\n<h3>Moving items in Kanban view</h3>\n\nTo move an item within a list, just drag and drop it into the position you want to see it:\n\n<img 5 - drag and drop item in list kanban>\n\nMoving items between Kanban lists (labels) is just as simple. You can drag and drop items across lists:\n\n<gif 1 - drag and drop items kanban>\n\nOr you can simply apply a different label to an item and it will move to the right list accordingly:\n\n<gif 2 - add label to move list kanban> \n\nPlease note, these changes will be seen by every member of your collection.\n\n<h3>Reordering lists</h3>\n\nIf you prefer to see your lists in a different order (for example, if you'd like to see the 'Done' list first because you want to see how far your project has come), you can easily reorder the lists.\n\nJust click & hold the list header to drag and drop the entire list to the place you'd prefer.\n\n<gif 3 - reordering lists kanban>\n\nPlease note, this is one of the few changes that affects all users. If you reorder Kanban lists, every member of the collection will see them in that way.\n\n<h3>Changing list headers</h3>\n\nIn Zenkit, any label or member field can be used as Kanban list headers. You may have set up label fields to show progress (to do, doing, done) and priority (high, medium, low). You can easily switch between the two, or any label group you create. \n\nClick on the Kanban icon at the top right, then click ‘Details’ to drop down the view options. \n\n<img 5 - kanban list header switch>\n \nUnder ‘Vertical Grouping’ select the label field you’d like from the drop down menu.\n\n<h3>Using 2D Kanban</h3>\n\nIn Kanban view, you can choose to group your items by labels vertically and horizontally, like a matrix. \n\n<img 6 - 2d kanban matrix>\n \nClick on the Kanban icon at the top-right. Click ‘Details’ to drop down the view options.\n\n<img 7 - create 2d kanban with horizontal field>\n\nClick on the dropdown menu where it says ‘Horizontal Grouping’ and select Members or the Label you’d like to group by. For example, you could group by Progress vs. Priority, or Member vs. Progress.\n\nTo return to normal Kanban view, just return to the the details dropdown menu and select 'None' in the horizontal grouping menu.","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"Guide to grouped records\nAirtable's grouped records feature allows you to show your records grouped together based on one (or more) fields of your choosing. \n\n\n\nGetting started with grouped records\n\nDragging between groups to reassign values\n\nGrouped records and the summary bar\n\n \n\nGetting started with grouped records\n\nTo group your records, open up a grid view and click on the \"Group\" button located between the filter and sort buttons.\n\n\n\nSelect the field by which you'd like to group your records from the dropdown menu. Note that you cannot group by an attachment field.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also group your records by multiple fields by clicking the \"Pick another field to group by\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also change the sort order of the groups by clicking on the sort order buttons after each grouped-by field's \"Group by {Field name} from.\"\n\n\n\nGroups also work with filters.\n\n\n\nTo remove a group, click on the X button to the right of the specified grouped-by field.\n\n\n\n \n\nDragging between groups to reassign values\n\nYou can change the values on a record in a group by clicking and dragging the record to a different group using the drag handle on the left side of the record. For example, you could drag a task assigned to one person to another person's group, and that task would automatically be re-assigned to the new person.\n\n\n\n \n\nGrouped records and the summary bar\n\nThere is a summary bar at the top of every group, which can summarize the cell values in numerical fields by each group. These summary bars let you see the subtotals of each grouping. Every grouping will also have a count of the number of records in each grouping.\n\n\n\nMuch like the summary bar for the whole table, the summary bar for each group can provide different summary

and aggregation fields allow you to create new information from existing data in the collection, or even from other collections!\n\nWhen you create a formula field, it applies to every single item in a collection. Think of it as applying a formula to an entire column in a normal spreadsheet. The formula takes in information from other fields in the collection to create new information (in a normal spreadsheet: taking in data from other columns to calculate something for each row).\n\nTo learn more about basic field types that don't calculate new information, read our <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/By04o9z0\" target=\"_blank\">guide to basic fields</a>.\n\n<h3>Formulas</h3>\n\nThe formula field allows you to create formulas using common operators or functions on number or reference fields in your collection. \n\nFor example, if you wanted to calculate the cost of labor for a task, your formula would look like this:\n\nWage * Time\n\nIf you use number fields with spaces in their names, you need to wrap them in braces (Zenkit will do this automatically):\n\nSum({Material Costs}, {Tool Costs})\n\nUse brackets () as you would in normal mathematical functions to change the order of operations:\n\n({Wage} * {Time}) + Materials\n\nFor example, in your spaceship building collection, each task has an ‘Hourly Wage’ field, a ‘Materials Cost’ field, and an ‘Estimated Time’ field. You want to calculate the estimated cost of each task in the project. \n\nYou create an ‘Estimated Cost’ formula field that multiplies ‘Hourly Wage’ by ‘Estimated Time’ and adds ‘Material Cost’. The estimated cost for each task is then displayed on each item in the collection!\n\n<gif 1 - create formula field properties>\n\n<h3>Guide to using functions and formulas</h3>\n\nWhen you start typing a formula into the formula options field, Zenkit will show you a dropdown of available operators, functions and aggregations you can use.\n\nThe first thing you'll be shown is a dropdown list of all number fields in your current collection, or referenced number fields.\n\nSelect a field you want to work with from the dropdown menu, or type in a number you want to use.\n\n<img 1 - using formula fields>\n\nAdd an operator then type in another number or choose from the list again. \n\n<img 2 - formula field numerical operators>\n\nWhen you're done creating your formula, click 'Create' to apply it to every item in your collection.\n\nWhen creating formulas, make sure to watch out for braces and brackets! Misplaced brackets can cause your field to throw an error.\n\nTo learn more about the operations and functions you can use, please read the article on <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/SJVhB7tA\" target=\"_blank\">formula fields</a>.\n\n<h3>Aggregations</h3>\n\nEven though you can select it from the 'Add Field' dropdown list, an aggregation will actually create a formula field. An aggregation is essentially a formula-building wizard that makes it easier to build formulas using references.\n\nWhen you create a new aggregation, it will recognise which reference fields are included in your collection, and pull number fields from inside those references.\n\n<img 3 - add aggregation total lifetime value>\n\nYou then choose the function to apply to those values - a sum, count or average.\n\nOnce you click 'Create', Zenkit will create a formula field that sums, counts or averages the number field you chose inside referenced items for each item.\n\nFor example, if you have referenced three invoices from your billing collection to a customer in your customers collection, you can create an aggregation that sums the totals of those three invoices into a 'Total lifetime value' field. Every time you add a new invoice to that customer, the total lifetime value will update to include it.\n\n<img 4 - total lifetime value kevin spacey>","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"Guide to formula, lookup, count, and rollup fields\nFormula, lookup, count, and rollup fields (columns) are powerful field types that allow you to compute a value based on values in other cells.\n\nThese fields are configured in the field configuration menu. To learn about the basic, non-computed field types, see the article \"Guide to the basic field types.\"\n\nNote that these computed field types are slightly different from formulas in a spreadsheet. In a spreadsheet, you can put a formula in any cell, and have it reference any other cell in the sheet. In Airtable, you configure computed fields that apply the same formula to every record in the table. As such, these formulas reference other fields rather than other cells so that they apply to every record.\n\nNote that the rollup, lookup, and count fields can only be used when you have a record link field in your table.\n\nTo see some real-life examples of how a nonprofit uses formula, lookup, count, and rollup fields to run their organization, head on over to our blog.\n\nEach computed type is described in more detail below.\n\nFormula\n\nLookup\n\nCount\n\nRollup\n\n \n\nFormulas \n\n\n\nFormulas allow you to compute a value in each record based on other cells in that same record. For example, if you have a table of product orders, you can create a field that computes the Total Cost for each record based on the Price and Quantity.\n\n\n\nTo configure a formula, select the \"Formula\" type from the field configuration menu. From there, you can enter the formula into the text box as you would in a spreadsheet, except you use column names instead of cell ranges. A formula can be composed of functions (e.g. SUM, CONCATENATE), operators (e.g. +, -, *, /, &), and other columns from the same table.\n\nWhen you start entering your formula, you will see suggestions of columns and functions you can use in the formula.\n\n\n\nIf your formula will result in a numerical output, you have the option of formatting the formula's result as a decimal, an integer, a currency, or a percent, and of selecting the precision (for decimals, currencies, or percentages).\n\n\n\nFor a complete reference of formula functions and operators, please refer to the Formula Field Reference.\n\n \n\nLookups\n\n\n\nA lookup field allows you to look up a specific field in a linked record.\n\nFor example, if you have an \"Orders\" table with a field linking to \"Clients\", you could create a lookup field that displays the linked client's address.\n\n\n\nLookup configuration is pretty straightforward. First, you pick the field with the linked records you want to look up. Then, you pick the cell on those linked records that you want to display.\n\nNote that if there are multiple linked records, the lookup will concatenate the cell values and separate them with a comma.\n\n\n\n \n\nCount\n\nA count field lets you count the number of linked records in a record link column. To configure a count column, you simply choose the column with the linked records that you want to count.\n\n\n\n \n\nRollups\n\n\n\nA rollup field performs calculations or formulas on specific cells from records that are linked to another field in your table. Sound complicated? It’s not! Watch this video guide and get started in seconds. Spreadsheet users can think of the rollup field as a way of creating more sophisticated pivot tables.\n\nA rollup field lets you aggregate values from linked records. For example, consider a database that helps the owner of a furniture store keep track of orders and pieces of furniture. A single order could contain several pieces of furniture. This could be represented by linking several furniture records to each order. A rollup would then allow you to calculate the total price of the furniture records in each order.\n\n\n\nYou configure a rollup by first selecting the field that links to the records you're interested in aggregating.\n\nYou then select the cell on those records that you'd like to aggregate.\n\nThe last step is to select a way to aggregate the cell values from the linked records. Average, sum, min and max are a few examples of aggregation functions you can use on a rollup.\n\nWhen you start editing the aggregation input, you will see suggestions for potential rollup functions with a brief description of each function.\n\n\n\nFor a complete reference of rollup aggregation functions, please see our rollup field reference.\n\nNote that a rollup field will roll up data from all records in the target linked table, regardless of whether or not those records have been filtered in some way. If you only want to rollup certain linked records in each cell, you will need to use IF formulas to make conditional rollups.","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[120,198,199,200,201],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[{"id":120,"shortId":"BkF_H7KA","uuid":"158dbdda-61b3-4352-ae81-310ba823449b","fileName":"create_formula_field_properties.mp4","size":1224851,"mimetype":"video/mp4","isImage":false,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/BkF_H7KA","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-10T14:28:01.1+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-10T14:28:01.1+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":{},"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":198,"shortId":"SkY8zQf1l","uuid":"826ee92b-588a-44cb-a0f7-6202948cf6d0","fileName":"using_formula_fields.PNG","size":38054,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/SkY8zQf1l","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-17T10:05:04.743+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-17T10:05:04.743+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":199,"shortId":"S1tPz7Gyl","uuid":"d31d859b-c90e-440e-8c09-40ad7c77a0ed","fileName":"formula_field_numerical_operators.PNG","size":21461,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/S1tPz7Gyl","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-17T10:05:20.557+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-17T10:05:20.557+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":200,"shortId":"H10_z7fkg","uuid":"c01ce903-4c27-49ad-9402-5a9616aa0e2f","fileName":"add_aggregation_total_lifetime_value.PNG","size":69964,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/H10_z7fkg","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-17T10:05:42.302+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-17T10:05:42.302+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":201,"shortId":"SJrFzXzkg","uuid":"418a5bde-1086-4178-9a96-91124f82fb0d","fileName":"total_lifetime_value_kevin_spacey.PNG","size":34971,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/SJrFzXzkg","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-17T10:05:48.782+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-17T10:05:48.782+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"},{"h":"400","w":"400","crop":"0,0,40,40"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"}],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":51,"shortId":"rJS5BXYR","uuid":"1df02821-1809-4318-8e7f-1f3012dce9ff","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-10T14:28:29.155Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T13:20:31.924Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Aggregations","sortOrder":"0.9978500000000002","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Aggregations","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[14],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"bd0dab72-532b-4b5e-a51d-067f70e36e85","id":14,"name":"Advanced field types and workflows"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[5],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"f68c3894-e4d7-4d02-8755-7ef9639c2ab9","id":5,"name":"done"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"Aggregations are not a field in and of themselves.

fields. Think of them as the glue that holds different parts of your company or project together.\n\n<h3>What is a reference field?</h3>\n\nReference fields let you connect two related items in separate collections. It's what makes Zenkit more powerful than most other spreadsheets or productivity or work management tools. References essentially allow you to create a database, without having to be a database expert.\n\nFor example, in your Mission to Mars team, you have a collection of all the staff members, as well as collections for various projects.\n\nIn your 'Build Spaceship' collection, you could create a reference field that links to the engineer from the 'Mars Staff' collection responsible for each task.\n\n<img 1 - references in table view>\n\n<img 2 - references in detail view>\n\nWhen you click on a reference, it opens a reference field popup of the item, in this case, Mister Mechanic from 'Mars Staff'.\n\n<img 3 - reference field popup>\n\nYou can see all the information about him from the Mars Staff collection, including his contact details, and other projects he's referenced in.\n\n<h3>Add a new reference field</h3>\n\nYou add a reference field in the same way you add any field. Click 'Add Field' in the far right hand column of the table view, or open an item in any view, click the ... icon and click 'Add Field'. Choose 'References'.\n\nWhen you add a new reference field, you can choose an existing collection to reference, or create a new collection. You can even choose to reference a collection to itself.\n\n<img 4 - references options>\n\nIf you choose to create a new collection, you can name it from the references options panel.\n\n<img 5 - add reference create new collection>\n\nYou can also choose whether users can create new items on the go, and whether you can select from items that already exist in the referenced collection. \n\nWhen you link two collections in this way, each collection will receive a reference field.\n\n<h3>Create new items inside a referenced collection</h3>\n\nIf you choose to allow members to create new items, this gives them the ability to create a new item <em>inside the referenced collection</em> from inside another collection. \n\nFor example, you need to create a new task in the Mission Control collection that falls under Bob the Builder's administration. You expand 'Bob the Builder' inside the 'Mars Staff' collection, then click on 'Add a reference' under 'Mission Control'.\n\n<img 6 - create a new item from references>\n\nTo create the new item, you just start typing - in this case 'Regulate internal heating panels' - then hit Enter. This will create an item called 'Regulate internal heating panels' inside the 'Mission Control' collection.\n\n<img 7 - type to create new item in reference>\n\nAlternatively, you can just select 'Create new item' from the dropdown menu. This way you create an unnamed item, which you can update later on.\n\n<img 8 - unnamed new item in reference>\n\nYou can also create a new referenced item directly in table view. In the reference field column, double click on the cell you'd like to add the reference to. Type in the new item you'd like to create, or click 'Create new item'.\n\n<img 9 - create new item in reference table view>\n\n<h3>Selecting existing items inside a referenced collection</h3>\n\nYou can also select items that already exist inside the referenced collection. When you click 'Add a reference', Zenkit will suggest a few from the existing items in the dropdown menu, or you can search for them:\n\n<img 10 - search and suggest references>\n\nSimply type in part of the name of the item you want to reference and choose from the suggested items in the dropdown list.\n\nYou can also use this in table view. In the reference field column, double click on the cell you'd like to add the reference to. Use the same steps as above to search for and select the item you want to reference.\n\n<h3>Removing a reference</h3>\n\nSay you've added a reference by mistake, or some references are no longer relevant. Don't worry! It's easy to remove a reference.\n\nIn any collection, expand the item you want to remove a reference from. When you hover over the reference, two small icons will appear in the corner. Click on the x to remove the reference.\n\n<img 11 - remove reference from detail view>\n\nIn table view you can also remove a reference by double-clicking inside the cell that contains the reference (but not on the referenced item itself!) then clicking the x next to the reference you want to delete.\n\n<img 12 - remove reference from table view>\n\n<h3>Editing referenced items</h3>\n\nYou can edit referenced items just like you would edit a normal item in a collection.\n\nFrom the details view, click on the name of the item. In the table view, click on the item under the reference field (column).\n\nThis will open a popup that looks just like a normal item detail popup. From here you can rename the item, edit information in any field, and even add new fields! \n\n<img 13 - edit referenced item>\n\nA word of caution - Don't forget that you're editing items in another collection! For example, adding a field via a referenced item will add that field to every item in the referenced collection!\n\nIf you click on a referenced item inside a referenced item, it'll open another popup. This can go on and on, without you ever leaving your original collection!\n\n<h3>Figuring out the true location of a referenced item</h3>\n\nTo avoid this kind of confusion, items in details view show a description of their true location under the item name.\n\nFor example, if you're in the 'Spaceship Build' collection and open the 'Test heat panels' task, then click on the referenced Engineer in Charge, 'Mister Mechanic', you will be shown this description:\n\n<img 14 - referenced item location>\n\nFirst the true location is given in the form of {item} in {collection}: 'Staff Member in Mars Staff'. \n\nThen it tells you the item it's referenced by in the collection you're currently in, and the name of the reference field: 'referenced by Test heat panels > Engineer in Charge'.\n\n<h3>What happens when a user doesn't have access to a referenced collection?</h3>\n\nIf you reference items from collections that have different members sets, users who are not members of both collections will be unable to see the referenced items.\n\n<img 15 - reference no collection access>\n\nUsers who don't have access to the referenced items will be able to see that items are referenced, but won't see the detail. They will also not be able to add or remove the references.","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"Linked record fields\nOne of the major advantages of using Airtable over a spreadsheet program is the ability to easily link records of related data. This powerful feature is exceptionally helpful where data spans more than two tables. For example, if you had a \"Contacts\" table and a \"Companies\" table, you could create a field that links each contact to the company they work for. \n\n\n\nIn the example above, clicking on the record for Lenore Maxwell would show us all of her information from the Contacts table, such as her picture and telephone number, and a preview of information about the New York Times from the Companies table.\n\n\n\nLinking Existing Tables of Related Records\n\nLearn how to link tables of related information below by watching the video demonstration below. \n\n\n\nWhen matching existing values, note that any commas included should be wrapped in double quotation marks to prevent commas acting as a separator. For example, the value “Chicago, IL” would create two separate entries – ‘Chicago’ and ‘IL’ if quotation marks were not included.\n\nCreating a New Linked Table\n\nLearn how to create a linked table from scratch and populate it with information from linked records. \n\n\n\nCreating Multiple Links Between Tables\n\nYou can constrain record links so that you can link to one or multiple records in the other table. In the video below, we provide an example of linking multiple columns in one table to the same linked table.","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,190],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[{"id":157,"shortId":"B1OGPKqA","uuid":"7a1ee324-437b-48fb-a2cb-2e057836566c","fileName":"references_in_detail_view.PNG","size":39924,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/B1OGPKqA","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-11T15:36:48.065+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-11T15:36:48.065+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"w":"240"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan

Here are the main ways that you can collaborate with other people in Airtable:\n\nCreate a team\n\nShare a single base\n\nCreate a base share link\n\nCreate a view share link\n\n \n\nCreate a team\n\nThis is for when you have a group of people with whom you'd like to collaborate on many different bases.\n\nOnce you've created a team, you can invite team collaborators. Team-level collaborators have access to all current bases in the team, and will have access to any new bases created in the team. To learn how to add a team collaborator, check out the Adding a team-level collaborator article.\n\nYou can create as many teams as you'd like for free, and each one has its own set of team members and bases.\n\nIf you upgrade to a premium plan, you'll need to pay for each team-level collaborator.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nShare a single base\n\nIf you want to share a single base with a collaborator without giving them access to any other bases within the team, you can add a base-level collaborator.\n\n\n\n \n\nCreate a base share link\n\nYou may want to share a base with someone without making them a full base- or team-level collaborator. To do this, you can generate a private share link which will allow a person to view a read-only version of that base.\n\n\n\nTo learn how to do this, see this article on Creating a share link for an entire base.\n\n  \n\nCreate a view share link\n\nIf all you want is to share some (but not all) of the information in a base with another person, then you can send them a view share link. This will allow a person to see a read-only version of a specified table view.\n\n\n\nTo learn how to do this, see this article on Creating a table view share link.","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":66,"shortId":"Bk0VuXYR","uuid":"b2982121-656b-446a-af2f-9e8245ff8179","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-10T14:39:50.128Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T12:26:40.503Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"User permissions","sortOrder":"0.9982750000000002","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"User permissions","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[15],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"0461fd4b-0786-4324-a17c-20f8bd4abfe9","id":15,"name":"Collaboration"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[5],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"f68c3894-e4d7-4d02-8755-7ef9639c2ab9","id":5,"name":"done"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[7],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"77d7d06d-ebbb-437f-a4ef-0a13136041e7","id":7,"name":"Upcoming"}],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"Zenkit currently separates users by member levels - Owner & Users.\n\n<h3>User permissions</h3>\n\nThe collection owner is the only member who can delete a collection, or move it to another team.

Check out our <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/r1OTGPw1g\" target=\"_blank\">Zapier examples</a> for a list of popular Zaps using Zenkit!\n\nOnce you've set up a Zap, Zapier will check your trigger app every few minutes, and then, if the trigger occurs, it performs the action for you!\n\n<h3>Connecting Zenkit to Zapier</h3>\nWhen you log in to <a href=\"https://www.zapier.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zapier</a> for the first time, you'll be taken to the 'Explore' page. To create your first Zap, click on 'Make a Zap!'.\n\n<img 1 - make a zap button>\n\nYou'll be taken to the Zap editor page. Here you can set up your Zap by choosing your trigger and action Zaps.\n\nWhether you use Zenkit as the trigger or the action, you'll need to connect it. Zapier will prompt you to do this when you connect a new account during the trigger set up. A pop up window will ask you to enter your API key.\n\n<img - connect a new zenkit account to zapier>\n\nJust copy and paste your Zenkit API key from your <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/SJW3vE9C\" target=\"_blank\">Zenkit profile page</a>.\n\n<h3>Setting up Zenkit triggers</h3>\n\n<img - zapier trigger 1>\n\nThere are a few steps to setting up a trigger. First, you need to choose the app you'll use as a trigger. You'll see the apps you've already connected to Zapier under 'Your Apps'. If Zenkit isn't yet connected, type 'Zenkit' into the search bar.\n\n<img - zapier trigger 2>\n\nNext, you choose the exact trigger you want to use from Zenkit. Each trigger has a description so you can be sure you're picking the right one. Click 'Save + Continue' when you've chosen.\n\n<img - zapier trigger 3>\n\nIf you've already connected a Zenkit account or two, select one from the list. If not, click 'Connect a New Account'. Make sure it's the right one!\n\n<img - zapier trigger 4>***** When accounts are finally connected, list of accounts\n\nOnce you've chosen an account, you can select the trigger options. Zapier gives you the ability to choose, for example, which Zenkit collection you want to be notified about new items from.\n\n<img - zapier trigger 5>*trigger options\n\nThe last step is testing the trigger. Zapier will look for a sample of the trigger in your Zenkit account, and will make sure the fields and test actions match up. Make sure you have items that match the trigger before you test! You'll be able to review the test results before you continue.\n\n<img - zapier trigger 6>*test gif?\n\nThen you're done with setting up your Zenkit trigger! \n\nHere are some examples of how you could use Zenkit to trigger other apps:\n\n- Send an email to your work address (action) every time you're added as a member to an item in Zenkit (trigger).\n-*\n-*\n\nFor more examples of how to use Zenkit with other apps in Zapier, check out our <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/r1OTGPw1g\" target=\"_blank\">Zapier examples</a>.\n\n<h3>Setting up Zenkit actions</h3>\n\nSetting up Zenkit actions is very similar to setting up triggers. Once you've set up a trigger from another app, click under 'Action' where it says '2. Set up this step' to set up an action. If you want to set up more than one action, click on the large + button to set up another, or click on the small + button to set up a filter, or an action between two existing steps.\n\n- Create a new item in a Zenkit social media collection (action) every time your account is @mentioned in Twitter (trigger).\n- Create a new item in your fitness collection (action) when a Runkeeper (or other fitness app) activity is logged (trigger).\n-*\n\nFor more examples of how to use Zenkit with other apps in Zapier, check out our <a

For example, you may want changes in your \"Applicant Tracking\" base to notify your team in the \"#recruiting\" slack channel on a daily basis, while changes in your \"Bugs\" base are posted to your \"#dev\" channel immediately.\n\nTo set up a new Slack notification rule, go to the base you want to receive notifications from and click \"Slack notifications\":\n\n\n\nOr go to the Slack notifications page directly, where you can add a new notification rule or see all of the other rules that you've set up:\n\n\n\nFrom here, you can create a new notification rule by clicking \"Add a slack notification rule\" or modify an existing notification rule.\n\nIn the notification rule configuration page, first select the base you'd like to post updates from, if it hasn't been set already.

Make some updates to the base that you selected in the rule, and watch Slack to see the updates appear.","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":79,"shortId":"H1osFQYA","uuid":"94ec16ba-1810-4214-b392-64e2d3e04935","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-10T14:45:54.872Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T14:47:50.791Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Using IFTTT to integrate Airtable with other apps and services","sortOrder":"1.0079499999999992","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Using IFTTT to integrate Airtable with other apps and services","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[16],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"dec938eb-5937-45d3-8f07-44cb12315fbc","id":16,"name":"Connecting Zenkit to other services"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[3],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"6503a58f-6c18-491b-b051-e5755734cd71","id":3,"name":"airtable original / todo"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[7],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"77d7d06d-ebbb-437f-a4ef-0a13136041e7","id":7,"name":"Upcoming"}],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/220336747-Using-IFTTT-to-integrate-Airtable-with-other-apps-and-services","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":80,"shortId":"HkKaKQKA","uuid":"519694b1-22a3-4f57-be25-c499a5e54f76","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-10T14:46:24.612Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T11:52:45.595Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Using Zapier to integrate Airtable with Google Calendar","sortOrder":"1.0033499999999997","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Using Zapier to integrate Airtable with Google Calendar","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[16],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"dec938eb-5937-45d3-8f07-44cb12315fbc","id":16,"name":"Connecting Zenkit to other services"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[4],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"f1ccb072-a3de-48bf-ae3e-aa5e6b01d150","id":4,"name":"in progress"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[7],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"77d7d06d-ebbb-437f-a4ef-0a13136041e7","id":7,"name":"Upcoming"}],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"Using Zapier to integrate Airtable with Google Calendar\nYou can use a 3rd party service called Zapier to integrate between Airtable and Google Calendar.

You have a Due Date column with dates, and a checkbox column called Completed.\n\nThere are three possible outcomes you would want to mark:\n\nIf the Completed box is checked, the Status field will say ✅Done✅\nIf the Completed box isn't checked, and the Due Date is before today, the Status field will say ⏰OVERDUE⏰\nIf the Completed box isn't checked, and the Due Date is today or after today, the Status field will say 🏃In-progress🏃 \nTranslating this into a formula, we would get:\n\nIF({Completed?} = 1, \"✅Done✅\",IF(IS_BEFORE({Due date}, TODAY()), \"⏰OVERDUE⏰\",\"🏃In-progress🏃\"))\n\n\n\n \n\nTo make the overdue records stand out more, you could also make the ✅Done✅ and 🏃In-progress🏃 records blank by using double quotation marks with nothing inside:\n\nIF(Completed = 1, \"\",IF(IS_BEFORE({Due date}, TODAY()), \"⏰OVERDUE⏰\",\"\"))\n\n\n\nNow, go forth and write some IF formulas! 👍💥🔥💣","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":100,"shortId":"BJw_3QYA","uuid":"e6904c02-2ea7-4935-8775-3eb5c81bbea5","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-10T14:57:51.286Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T15:07:33.740Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Moving records using copy and paste","sortOrder":"1.0073999999999992","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Moving records using copy and paste","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[21],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"7f6c3a52-9513-481f-8f89-4100db897828","id":21,"name":"Tips & Tricks"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[3],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"6503a58f-6c18-491b-b051-e5755734cd71","id":3,"name":"airtable original / todo"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"Moving records using copy and paste\n\n\nCopying and pasting cells in Airtable from Airtable on Vimeo.\n\nYou can paste a single cell or a range of cells across one or many cells.

(You can also use it to export one of your bases to use in a different account.)\n\nThis is a great way for you to share interesting collections of data. Perhaps you’ve compiled a list of must-read books, and you want to share that list with your friends. With a share link, your friends can each make their own copies of your book base, check off books as they read through the list, and add new books of their own.\n\nIt’s also a good method for sharing the tools you’ve designed to manage your workflow. Maybe, in the course of running your blog, you’ve devised an incredibly useful editorial calendar and you want other bloggers to be able to use your same setup. Anyone with the share link to this base can clear out your data and use it for their own purposes.\n\n \n\nHow to make your base available for copying\n\nTo share a whole base, click the \"Share\" button while in your base, and then click on the \"Create a shared link to the whole base\" option under the “Link sharing” header.\n\n\n\nClicking the “private read-only link” option will generate a share link for the base. Bear in mind that this link will be \"live,\" in the sense that anyone opening the link will see all your recent changes to the base.\n\nNotice the checkbox that says \"Allow viewers to copy the data in this base\":\n\n\n\nIf this box is checked, then, if you send someone the share link, they'll see a “Copy base” button.\n\n\n\nClicking this button will allow that person to create a private copy of that base for their own purposes. Note that the person who copied the base will not receive any subsequent updates to your base, nor will you see any of their content or changes in the copied bases. For all intents and purposes, the copied base is completely separate from, and not connected in any way to, the original template base.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make your base copyable to an even wider audience, then you can embed your base on your website. Clicking the \"Embed\" option will bring you to a preview page which will show you what the embed will look like on desktop and mobile, and give you an embed code.\n\n\n\nIf the \"Allow viewers to copy the data in this base\" box is checked, then the embed(s) will have \"Copy base\" buttons at the bottom, which any viewers can click to make copies of the base for themselves.","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":103,"shortId":"BJx52XtR","uuid":"f6b9b628-b666-4f59-9c21-1d8f748512e0","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-10T14:58:15.869Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T13:21:54.549Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Importing an Airtable CSV of any language into another spreadsheet app","sortOrder":"1.0030499999999996","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Importing an Airtable CSV of any language into another spreadsheet app","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[22],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"4a59f0a3-e32e-433d-90ea-6873a49d6df7","id":22,"name":"Miscellaneous"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[3],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"6503a58f-6c18-491b-b051-e5755734cd71","id":3,"name":"airtable original / todo"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"Importing an Airtable CSV of any language into another spreadsheet app\nAfter you have exported your Airtable data to CSV and opened the file in Excel, you may encounter corrupted or unreadable characters depending on the language in which language the data was entered.

you use to recover your account if you forget your password, and where notifications will be sent. \n\nYou can also add additional email addresses that you can use to log in, but won't receive any data from Zenkit.\n\nTo learn how to do this, please read the article on <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/Bk7K9X0C\" target=\"_blank\">email address

backgrounds and themes give you control over how Zenkit looks. The best thing? It's personal. Any theme or background you set from your profile will only be seen by you, so you can totally have a cat gif as your background, even if it would drive the rest of your team mad.\n\n<h3>Backgrounds</h3>\nYou can choose your personal background from your profile settings page under the 'Background' tab. Collection and team backgrounds can be set from the 'Background' tab in the collection or team settings popup. All show the same structure:\n\n<img 1 - profile background>\n\n<strong>Colors</strong> refer to solid colors to use as a background.\n<strong>Images</strong> refer to images selected by the Zenkit team.\n<strong>Textures</strong> refer to tiled, textured backgrounds chosen by the Zenkit team.\n\nWhen you choose from these preset background types, Zenkit will also automatically apply a certain theme type that matches the background.\n\n<h3>Themes</h3>\nThemes dictate how text, items, and menus are displayed. Themes are a preset selection of light and dark items and text, as well as transparent or non-transparent item and menu styles. We'll keep updating this section with more theme types!\n\n<h3>Customs</h3>\nCustoms allow to to completely customize your background, theme type, item style & display style.\n\nClick on the + icon to add a new custom style, then upload an image of your choice.\n\n<img 2 - edit customs>\n\nOnce your image is uploaded, click on 'Edit' to bring up the customization menu.\n\n<img 3 - customs menu>\n\n<strong>Display Type</strong> chooses between displaying your chosen image as a tile or completely covering the background.\n\n<img 4 - tiled background>\n\n<img 5 - cover background>\n\n<strong>Theme Type</strong> lets you choose an appropriate theme for the chosen image. Light works best when your chosen background is light, and therefore creates light items & menus with dark text.\n\n<img 6 - light theme type>\n\nThe dark theme type usually suits a dark background and creates dark items and menus with light text.\n\n<img 7 - dark theme type>\n\n<strong>Item Style</strong> lets you choose whether your items and menus are completely filled in or slightly transparent.\n\n<img 8 - regular item style>\n\n<img 9 - transparent item style>\n\n<h3>Customization heriarchy</h3>\nBecause you can customize Zenkit at three different levels (profile, collection and team), it follows a hierarchy to determine which background or theme to show you.\n\nThe hierarchy is as follows:\n\n<strong>Collection > Team > Profile</strong>\n\nThis means that the collection background overrides the rules of the other two. If someone sets the collection background to anything other than 'No Background', all members of that collection will see that background.\n\nA team background will override your profile background, but is overriden by the collection background.\n\nLastly, your profile background is what's shown on the home page, in your profile settings, and in all collections where the backgrounds at collection

Easy! Click on the word 'contains' and choose 'does not contain' instead!\n\n<img 3 - filter does not contain>\n\nThis dropdown list of conditions gives you multiple options to help find what you're looking for, especially if you can't remember an exact word or phrase. \n\nIt is important to note that some conditions can be applied to nearly all field filter types:\n\nIf you choose 'is not empty', Zenkit will filter for items that have anything at all entered into the field.\nIf you choose 'contains' Zenkit will filter for items with <em>any</em> of the given search terms/members/labels etc.. \nIf you choose 'is equal' it will filter for the items with <em>all</em> of the chosen members/labels/search terms. \n\n'Is equal' is therefore a more exact filter condition, and 'is not empty' is the least exact.\n\n<h3>Add a filter condition</h3>\n\nThe real magic happens when you need to drill down deeper. Click 'Add Condition...'.\n\nA dropdown menu showing all of the fields inside your collection will appear. Depending on the field you choose, you can apply different conditions.\n\nText, References & Links\n\nThe filter for specific text, reference or link fields is similar to the 'Any field' search.\n\n<img 4 - text filter conditions>\n\nIt will apply the condition you give it (contains, does not contain, starts with, is empty, etc.) to the search term you enter.\n\nMembers\n\nThe members filter lets you type to search for one or more collection members.\n\n<img 5 - members filter>\n\nYou can apply a limited range of conditions, including contains/does not contain, and is or is not empty.\n\nLabels\n\nThe labels filter lets you select one or more labels from that particular label field.\n\n<img 6 - label filter>\n\nThe range of conditions you can apply is the same as that for member fields. Remember 'contains' will look for items that contain at least one of your chosen labels, 'is equal' will look for items that have all of your chosen labels.\n\nDates\n\nThe dates filter lets you filter for a particular day (Yesterday, Today, or Tomorrow), week (Last Week, This Week), or a custom period of time. \n\n<img 7 - custom date filter>\n\nIf you choose 'Custom' you can enter the exact date (and even time!) range you need.\n\nFormulas & Numbers\n\nFormula and number fields let you filter for a single number or a range of numbers.\n\n<img 8 - number formula filters>\n\nYou can choose whether the result should conform to a few conditions eg. less than or equal to, greater than, not equal to, etc.\n\n<img 9 - number formula filter range conditions>\n\nYou can also filter for items where the number or formula field is empty or not.\n\nFiles\n\nFor file fields, you can apply the same conditions as text filters. This difference here is that it filters for a particular word or phrase contained in the titles of files attached to items instead.\n\n<img 10 - file attachment filter>\n\nCheckboxes\n\nThe checkbox filter lets you filter for checked or unchecked items.\n\n<img 11 - checkbox filter>\n\n<h3>AND/OR operators</h3>\n\nYou'll notice an 'AND' next to each of your conditions once you start adding more.\n\nThis is where you can change the Boolean operators that combine your different filter conditions. If you click on 'AND', you can switch it to 'OR'.\n\n<img 12 - and or filter>\n\n'AND' will combine your filters so that items you search for have to have all of the properties you define in your filters.\n\nFor example, you could filter for items that contain the word 'engine' anywhere in the item AND have 'Asmo' assigned as a member AND are labelled as 'To Do'. This would only return items that fit all three criteria.\n\n<img 13 - and filter>\n\nIf you set up the filter with 'OR', Zenkit will find items that fit <em>one</em> of the chosen criteria.\n\n<img 14 - or filter>\n\nIn our example, this will return items that either contain the word 'engine', OR have 'Asmo' assigned to them, OR are labelled 'To Do'. Naturally this will return a far larger number of items.\n\n<h3>Removing filters</h3>\nTo remove all the filters you've set, just click on the green x next to the filter icon in the top right hand corner.\n\n<img 15 - remove all filters>\n\nTo remove just one of the conditions you've added, click on the x that appears next to the filter condition name.\n\n<img 16 - remove one

actions allow you to make changes to multiple items inside of a collection at once. You can decide which items to change by either selecting them individually, or filtering for certain items. If you want to make changes to multiple items, here's how to select them:\n\n<h3>Selecting multiple items</h3>\n\nTo select multiple items in table view, hover over the row numbers on the left hand side of the table. Click the checkboxes that appear to select items. \n\n<img - select multiple items table view>\n\nTo select all of the items in the table, click the checkbox at the top of the column of checkboxes.\n\n<img - select all items table view>\n\nTo deselect an item, click its checkbox again.\n\nTo select multiple items in Kanban, list and calendar view, hold down the Alt key then click on the items you want to select. \n\n<img - select multiple items kanban view>\n\nTo deselect an item, click it again while holding Alt.\n\n<h3>Using the bulk actions menu</h3>\n\nThe bulk actions menu is found in the top right hand corner, and shows you how many items you have selected.\n\n<img - bulk actions menu>\n\n'Deselect all' is pretty self-explanatory, clicking this will deselect all items.\n\n'Reverse selection' will select every other item in your collection, except the ones you had originally selected.\n\n'Duplicate items' will duplicate all the items you have selected, including labels, assigned members, and any additional data you've added to them.\n\n'Archive items' will immediately archive all selected items.\n\nLast but not least, 'Replace values' is the real powerhouse tool that lets you perform a certain action on all selected items. Replace values, used in combination with a <a href=\"https://zenkit.com/collections/HJQBQ1Hw/views/ry7xbTpGi/entries/SyaSNwoR\" target=\"_blank\">filter</a> and then selecting all items (from the table view), gives you a powerful way to manage the details of a large but specific number of items. Lets dig into the details...\n\n<h3>Replace values</h3>\n\nWhen you click 'Replace values' from the bulk actions menu, a popup appears. Each of the four tabs lets you set, add, remove or replace certain values, depending on the field you choose to change. \n\n<img - replace values popup>\n\nThe only fields you won't be able to change in this way are the formula and file fields. To edit a formula field, you just need to edit the formula in the field properties popup. Files need to be added or removed from items on an individual basis.\n\n<strong>Set</strong>\n\n'Set' sets the value of a field. This means that it will overwrite any previously set value. It works in a slightly different way for each of the field types.\n\nText, Links & Numbers\nFor text, link and number fields, you just need to type in the new text, link or number that you'd like to set for your multiple items. \n\nReferences, Labels & Members\nDepending on the permissions given to the particular field, you can set one or more values.\n\nFor example, if the members field only allows you to set one member, you will only be able to set one. If your reference field allows you to create new references, you will also be able to do that here.\n\nJust start typing in the 'Value to set' field to start searching for members and references, or choose from the labels displayed to set them.\n\nDates\nFor date fields, you will be shown the calendar when you click in the box under 'Value to set'. Just set a date as you normally would. You can also set a time if your date field allows it.\n\nCheckbox\nFor a checkbox you can either select the checkbox or not. Simple!\n\n<strong>Add</strong>\n\n'Add' allows you to add more information to data that already exists in a field. It will not overwrite the existing field, just add to it. This option isn't available for all fields.\n\nText & Links\nAny text you add will append text that already exists in the field. For now, any text you add will be appended directly on to the end of the existing text, without a space in between. \n\nFor example, if you have 'www.example.com' written in a text field, you could add '/newpage' to change the link to 'www.example.com/newpage'.\n\nNumbers\nNumbers don't follow the same rule here. If you add a number, it will actually 'add' that number, instead of just appending it to the existing number.\n\nFor example, if the number field currently contains '10' and you add '4' the field will be updated to show '14' instead of '104'.\n\nReferences, Labels and Members\nDepending on the rules you've set for the particular field you're adding to, you can select additional references or labels from the existing ones, or create new ones.\n\nYou can search for and select new members to add if your members field allows more than one member to be added.\n\nExceptions\nThe fields you cannot add to are dates and checkboxes. You will also not be able to add to member and label fields that specify only one label or member. Use the Set function for those.\n\n<strong>Remove</strong>\n\nFor most fields, remove works as a 'find and delete' function. It will not remove all data from the fields, just the part of it that you specify. This option is not available for all fields.\n\nText & Links\nFor text and link fields, 'remove' will find a string of text inside your fields and remove it. This can be a letter, number, word, or entire sentence, and it will be removed even if it's surrounded by other text and characters.\n\nFor example, if you want to remove the 'www.' from all of your links for a cleaner look but still usable url, just type 'www.' into the 'Remove value' box. 'www.google.com' thus becomes 'google.com'.\n\nA word of caution: be as precise as you can! If you ask Zenkit to remove just one letter, then you will remove that letter from everywhere in the text. \n\nFor example, say you want to get rid of the extra 'r' at the end of this phrase: 'Red lorry, yellow lorryr'. If you ask Zenkit to just remove 'r', then you'll end up with 'ed loy, yellow loy'. You're better off using the replace function for tasks like this!\n\nNumbers\nJust as with 'add', 'remove' works slightly differently for number fields. Removing a number will subtract it from the number currently in the field.\n\nFor example, if you remove '24' from a field that contains '1024', it will be updated to show '1000' and not '10'.\n\nReferences, Labels & Members\nFor these fields, the remove function will allow you to remove references, labels and members from items that currently have some selected.\n\nYou will be able to search for and remove references or members, or select labels to remove from the display. \n\nExceptions\nYou cannot remove data from a checkbox or date field.\n\n<strong>Replace</strong>\n\nThis can also be thought of as 'search and replace', and works for every field type.\n\nText & Links\nHere is where the replace function shines. You can search for an exact string of text, and replace it with another, even if that string is surrounded by other text and characters. Again, it pays to be very precise.\n\nFor example, you could replace the '.com' in link fields containing 'www.example.com/newpage.html' with '.de' to create 'www.example.de/newpage.html'. \n\nIn a normal text field you could use this to replace whole words or phrases, or even correct spelling mistakes: replace 'wrold' with 'world' to fix 'Hello world!'.\n\nNumbers\nAs with 'add' and 'remove', numbers are treated as whole numbers, and not as their composite parts (or as strings). This means that you cannot replace one part of a number, but need to replace a whole number:\n\nYou can replace '5000' with '6000', but you cannot replace '5' with '6' to change 5000 to 6000.\n\nDates\nTo replace dates, just choose the date you want to replace from the calendar, and then choose a replacement date. This works for times as well.\n\nReferences, Labels & Members\nTo replace references, labels and members, just search for and select the reference, label or member you want to change, then do the same for the one you want to replace it with.\n\nThis also works if you want to replace multiple labels or members. For example, you could re-label items labelled with 'To Do' with both 'In Progress' and 'Bottleneck', should you need to. \nOr you could replace the members 'Sarah' and 'Rob' with 'Aisha' if the task needs to transfer from two hands to one.\n\nCheckbox\nThe checkbox is a special case. Since it's binary, there's only one option.\nIf you <em>select</em> the checkbox, it will replace all <em>unselected</em> checkboxes with selected ones.\nIf you leave the checkbox <em>unselected</em>, it will replace all <em>selected</em> checkboxes with unselected ones.","11bbb3ed-fee1-451c-82ab-5c2b92a35cb9_text":"","ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_files":[259,260,261,262,263],"ace42fea-dd18-4d3d-a5ff-8e9e048ff81e_filesData":[{"id":259,"shortId":"SkqGQ02Jx","uuid":"ce4a6d4d-9940-400a-9fb3-17a7b0e45129","fileName":"replace_values_popup.PNG","size":36575,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/SkqGQ02Jx","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-25T12:41:53.782+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-25T12:41:53.782+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"w":"240"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":260,"shortId":"Hyp8QCn1g","uuid":"c33dbcd8-ee2a-41a0-82d1-c5a0f8cc2813","fileName":"select_multiple_items_table_view.PNG","size":79389,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/Hyp8QCn1g","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-25T12:43:00.537+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-25T12:43:00.537+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"w":"240"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":261,"shortId":"S1lp87R2kx","uuid":"7d225716-8a0f-4635-8e5e-89d065aa59bd","fileName":"select_all_items_table_view.PNG","size":12159,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/S1lp87R2kx","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-25T12:43:00.718+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-25T12:43:00.718+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"w":"240"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":262,"shortId":"BkWT87C3kg","uuid":"3f8982a0-f4e9-4000-9800-718fc2bcffc5","fileName":"select_multiple_items_kanban_view.PNG","size":48122,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/BkWT87C3kg","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-25T12:43:00.916+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-25T12:43:00.916+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"},{"id":263,"shortId":"SyLKXC3yl","uuid":"b4cc94bb-4780-41d1-8e0c-03f96316b873","fileName":"bulk_actions_menu.PNG","size":22582,"mimetype":"image/png","isImage":true,"s3key":"production/list_files/HJQBQ1Hw/SyLKXC3yl","fileUrl":"","cropParams":{},"width":null,"height":null,"created_at":"2016-10-25T12:43:42.131+00:00","updated_at":"2016-10-25T12:43:42.131+00:00","deprecated_at":null,"uploaderId":797,"listId":230,"elementId":4800,"cachedQuerys":[{"h":"160"},{"h":"400","w":"400","crop":"0,0,40,40"}],"in_use":false,"userDisplayName":"Siobhan Potato"}],"2d25d4de-72f9-47dd-87b2-8fe68d8d1a35_date":null},{"id":115,"shortId":"BymfRan0","uuid":"5231ff89-1d74-41c9-b246-f1b7c0e5faea","listId":230,"created_at":"2016-10-13T09:04:10.683Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T13:09:42.827Z","deprecated_at":null,"origin_created_at":null,"origin_updated_at":null,"origin_deprecated_at":null,"created_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","updated_by_displayname":"Siobhan Potato","deprecated_by_displayname":"","created_by":797,"updated_by":797,"deprecated_by":null,"displayString":"Quick edit menu","sortOrder":"1.0073624999999993","comment_count":0,"checklists":[],"d918a1f9-95b8-4361-8400-6b5b8d7e16e1_text":"Quick edit menu","48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories":[21],"48d60014-69cc-495e-8327-c531d056b2af_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"7f6c3a52-9513-481f-8f89-4100db897828","id":21,"name":"Tips & Tricks"}],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories":[5],"2cbc8635-bb39-4cf1-bf4f-11ca5e8b85c0_categories_sort":[{"uuid":"f68c3894-e4d7-4d02-8755-7ef9639c2ab9","id":5,"name":"done"}],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories":[],"f8ae0874-563f-4908-813e-f7b2612cfda6_categories_sort":[],"b2444557-36cb-4e1f-8b5c-109e88ce9e0c_text":"The quick edit menu is a fast way to make changes to an item without expanding it.\n\nTo open the quick edit menu, double click on the item, or click on the edit icon that appears when you hover over the item.\n\n<img 1 - quick edit menu button>\n\nThe menu will open to the right of the item, and a cursor will appear in the item title.\n\n<img 2 - quick edit menu>\n\nYou can change the name of the item from here, or select an action from the quick edit menu.\n\nThe first option, 'Change Position', allows you to choose a label (Kanban list) to assign the item to, and where in that list it should be placed.
